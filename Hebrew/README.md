## Installtion ðŸ’¨ 
installations is easy due to the simple design of AMP.

2. Exstract The Files
3. Copy all the extracted files to your AMP ADS folder/webroot\
### What dose this mean?
ADS is the "dashboard instance" (the one that you see when you login and manage all the servers)\
To Install the translation you need to copy all the files and put it into the `/Web Root` folder\
You can find this folder by going into the ADS instance of your AMP installation\
inside `AMPDatastore`\
Example:\
`.../AMPDatastore/My-Dashbord/WebRoot`\
**You Need To Locate The Folder In Your Server**
